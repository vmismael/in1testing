        body: "The passwords people invent themselves are far weaker than they feel. Names, dates, favorite teams and predictable substitutions like 'P@ssw0rd' are exactly what attackers try first, and reused passwords mean a single leak can unlock dozens of accounts. A randomly generated password has no pattern to guess: every character is independent, so the only way to break it is brute force, which becomes astronomically slow as length grows. Generating a fresh random password for each account — and storing it in a password manager — is the single most effective habit for keeping your online life secure. Most large-scale account takeovers don't involve some clever hack at all; they happen because a password leaked from one breached site is quietly tried against email, banking and social accounts elsewhere. A unique random password per account breaks that chain completely, so even if one service is compromised, the damage stops there instead of spreading across your whole digital life.",

        heading: "Built on real cryptographic randomness",
        body: "Not all randomness is equal. Many simple tools rely on JavaScript's Math.random(), which is fast but predictable and never meant for security. In1 instead uses the Web Crypto API — specifically crypto.getRandomValues() — the same cryptographically secure random source browsers use for sensitive operations. That means the characters in your password are drawn from a high-quality, unpredictable entropy source, not a guessable sequence. The generator also makes sure every character type you enable actually appears in the result, so a password meant to include numbers and symbols never comes out missing them by chance. After guaranteeing one character from each selected set, it fills the rest from the combined pool and then shuffles everything, so the required characters aren't predictably parked at the front. The difference between a secure random source and a predictable one is not academic: a password built from a weak generator can sometimes be reproduced by an attacker who knows the algorithm, while one built from real entropy cannot.",

        heading: "You control length and character types",
        body: "Strength comes from two levers, and both are in your hands. Length is the most powerful: each extra character multiplies the number of possible combinations, so a longer password is exponentially harder to crack. Variety is the second: mixing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols expands the pool each character is chosen from. With In1 you set the exact length with a slider and toggle the four character groups on or off to satisfy whatever rules a particular site enforces. Want a long passphrase-length secret or a short PIN-style code? Both are a couple of clicks away. The live preview regenerates as soon as you change an option, so you can immediately see the effect of adding symbols or stretching the length. Some sites stubbornly reject certain symbols or cap the length, and being able to dial the exact mix means you can always produce a password that is both as strong as possible and actually accepted by the form in front of you.",

There is no account to create and no history to leak. When you copy the password and close the tab, no trace of it remains here. This local-only approach removes the biggest risk of online generators — the possibility that the very tool creating your password could be recording it. It is worth being skeptical of any generator that sends your password to a server, because there is simply no good reason for it to do so; everything needed to create a strong password already exists in your browser. Because the work is local, generation is also instant and keeps working even with no internet connection, so you can create credentials anywhere, anytime.",

Turn on two-factor authentication wherever it is offered for a second layer of defense, ideally with an authenticator app rather than SMS. For the accounts that matter most — email, banking, work — favor longer passwords with all character types enabled, since your email in particular is the master key that can reset many of your other logins. Avoid emailing or texting passwords to yourself, and never reuse a password just because it is convenient.

Pretty-printing makes it far easier to spot a missing field, trace a nested path, or compare two responses. Paste in whatever you have — compact, half-formatted or pasted from a terminal — and get back a tidy, properly indented document you can actually read. Once the structure is visible, problems that were hidden in a wall of text jump out: an array where you expected an object, a value that is a string when it should be a number, or a branch that is nested one level deeper than the rest of the payload.

That instant feedback turns 'why won't this parse?' into a quick fix. It is the fastest way to confirm that a payload, config file or copied snippet is valid before you ship it. Common culprits include trailing commas after the last item, single quotes instead of double quotes, missing quotation marks around keys, and unescaped characters inside strings — all of which strict JSON forbids even though they look harmless.

With one click you can switch between a readable, beautified version and a compact, production-ready one. The two operations are perfect complements in a normal workflow: minify a configuration blob before you paste it into an environment variable or a URL, then beautify it again later when you need to read or edit it.

It exists because many systems were built to move plain text reliably but can corrupt or misinterpret raw bytes — think email bodies, URLs, JSON fields, HTML attributes and HTTP headers. By translating data into a compact, text-only alphabet, Base64 lets you embed images, fonts, tokens or arbitrary text inside those text-only channels without anything getting mangled in transit. It does not encrypt or compress — the goal is safe, lossless transport — but it is one of the most common encodings you will meet when working with the web. The name comes from the size of its alphabet: the uppercase and lowercase letters, the digits zero through nine, and two extra symbols, plus a padding character. Every three bytes of input become four Base64 characters, which is why an encoded string is always a bit larger than the original — a deliberate trade of size for safety and compatibility.",

The result appears instantly and can be copied with one click, making it quick to round-trip a value, inspect an encoded token, or prepare data for a system that expects Base64 input. Because the output updates as you type and as you flip modes, it is easy to experiment: paste a suspicious-looking string, switch to decode, and immediately see whether it was Base64 at all. The same convenience helps when you are building a request by hand and need to encode a credential or a small payload without leaving the page.",

In1 encodes through the TextEncoder and decodes through the TextDecoder APIs, which means your text is first converted to proper UTF-8 bytes before encoding and reconstructed faithfully on the way back. Accented characters, non-Latin scripts, symbols and emoji all survive the round trip intact. Whether you are encoding Portuguese, Japanese, mathematical symbols or a string full of emoji, what you decode is exactly what you put in. This is more than a nice-to-have: the classic browser shortcut for Base64 throws an error or silently corrupts data when it meets a character outside the basic Latin range, which is exactly the kind of subtle bug that surfaces only in production with real user input. By handling Unicode correctly from the start, this tool gives you results you can trust regardless of the language or symbols involved.",

You can safely decode a token to inspect its contents or encode a sensitive value, confident that the data stays on your own device the whole time. This point deserves emphasis because Base64 is sometimes mistaken for a security measure, when in reality anyone can decode it in seconds. The only real protection for the data inside an encoded string is to never expose it in the first place — and a local-only tool that keeps your input on your machine is exactly the right way to handle anything sensitive.",

Basic authentication headers, email attachments (MIME), and many API parameters all rely on Base64. It is also handy for safely passing arbitrary text through URLs and query strings, or for storing binary-ish data in places that only accept text, such as certain database columns or environment variables. Whenever you need data to travel through a text-only channel intact, Base64 is the standard answer. Knowing how to quickly encode and decode it by hand is a small but genuinely useful skill — it turns an opaque string in a log or a config file into something you can actually read and reason about.

Print it once and it will scan years later. The trade-off is that a static code cannot be edited after the fact — if the link changes you generate a new code — but for the vast majority of uses, the reliability and independence of a static code is exactly what you want. Many commercial 'dynamic' QR services hide this distinction, offering editable codes that secretly route through their servers and can be locked behind a subscription you must keep paying to keep your code alive.

PNG is built for graphics, screenshots, logos and anything that needs crisp edges or a transparent background. WebP is the modern all-rounder that often beats both, producing smaller files at similar quality and supporting transparency too. This converter moves your image freely between all three, so you can take a screenshot saved as a heavy PNG and turn it into a lightweight JPG, modernize an old photo into WebP, or convert a WebP someone sent you into a PNG that every program can open. Picking the right format for the job is one of the simplest ways to make images load faster and behave the way you expect, and doing the conversion takes only a couple of clicks here.",

        body: "JPG and WebP are lossy formats, which means they trade a little visual fidelity for a much smaller file. How much they trade is up to you. When you convert to either format, a quality slider lets you choose the balance that fits your needs: keep it high for photos you want to look pristine, or lower it to squeeze the file down for a fast-loading web page or an email attachment. PNG, by contrast, is lossless, so converting to PNG always preserves every pixel exactly and the quality control simply does not apply. Being able to see and set the quality yourself means you are never stuck with a one-size-fits-all result — you decide whether file size or maximum sharpness matters more for this particular image, and you can try a different setting in seconds if the first one is not quite right.",

So when you convert a transparent PNG to JPG, those see-through regions have to become something solid. This converter fills them with a clean white background rather than leaving them black or producing strange fringing, which is what you almost always want for a logo or graphic that will sit on a page. Going the other way, converting to PNG or WebP keeps any transparency intact, so a graphic stays usable over any background. Understanding this one detail saves a lot of frustration, and the tool applies the sensible default automatically so your converted image looks right without any manual fixing. If you specifically need transparency in your final file, convert to PNG or WebP rather than JPG, and your see-through areas will be preserved exactly. Choosing the destination format with transparency in mind is the single most important decision when converting logos, icons and other graphics that need to float cleanly over a coloured background.",

Whatever the destination, the need is the same: get the picture into the right format, at the right size, without losing control of quality — and do it quickly, privately and for free. A good rule of thumb is to reach for JPG when the image is a photograph, PNG when it has sharp edges or transparency, and WebP when you want the smallest file for the web without giving up much quality.

This resizer lets you type the exact width and height you want and produces an image at those dimensions, no guessing involved. Because the work is done on a canvas at full precision, the output lands on the numbers you asked for.

To prevent that, the resizer keeps the aspect-ratio lock switched on by default: change the width and the height updates automatically to match the original proportions, and vice versa. This way your image is scaled cleanly without any squishing, and you only have to think about one dimension. When you genuinely need a non-proportional size — fitting an image into a fixed box where some distortion is acceptable, or deliberately changing the shape — you can simply turn the lock off and set width and height independently. Having both modes one click apart means you get safe, proportional resizing by default but never lose the flexibility to do something custom when the situation calls for it.",

        heading: "Shrink file size as a bonus",
        body: "Resizing is one of the most effective ways to make an image lighter, because file size is driven far more by pixel dimensions than people expect. A photo straight from a modern phone can be four or five thousand pixels wide — vastly more than any web page or email needs. Scaling it down to a sensible display size like 1200 or 1920 pixels wide can cut the file from several megabytes to a few hundred kilobytes while looking identical on screen, since the extra pixels were never visible at normal viewing sizes anyway. That makes resizing a quick win for faster-loading pages, smoother email attachments and more free space on your device. If you need to squeeze the file even further afterward, you can pair the resizer with a dedicated compressor, but very often resizing alone does the job. As a practical guide, most images shown on a typical screen never need to be wider than about 1920 pixels, and thumbnails or avatars need far less than that. Matching the pixel dimensions to how the image will actually be displayed is the smartest first step, because every pixel you remove that nobody would ever see is pure saved weight with no visible downside at all.",

This tool lets you add as many images as you like and turns each one into its own page, producing a single, self-contained document. It is the natural way to package scanned pages, a set of receipts, a batch of photos, screenshots of a conversation, or pictures of a handwritten form — anything that makes more sense as one ordered file than as a pile of separate images scattered across a folder. A PDF also travels far better than raw images: it keeps your pages in a fixed order, prints predictably, and opens the same way whether the recipient is on a phone, a laptop or a library computer. Image files, by contrast, can be reordered by a file manager, stripped of their sequence by an email client, or opened in a viewer that only shows one at a time, which is exactly the kind of friction a single PDF removes.",

The order you see on screen is the order of the pages in the finished PDF, so there are no surprises when you open the result. That control is essential for things like multi-page scans, where page two must follow page one, or a photo story that needs to read in a particular sequence.

Each page is sized to match its image, so pictures are never awkwardly cropped or forced into a shape that distorts them; a tall portrait photo produces a tall page and a wide screenshot produces a wide one.

A one-page PDF gives you a single JPG, while a multi-page document produces one image per page, neatly numbered. Because JPG is universally supported, the result opens instantly on any phone, computer or app, with no special reader required — which is exactly what makes images so much more convenient than PDFs in these situations. An image is also far easier to embed and preview: messaging apps and social platforms show it inline automatically, content editors place it like any other picture, and a thumbnail can be generated from it without extra tooling. A PDF, by contrast, usually shows up as a file attachment that the viewer has to deliberately open, which adds a step that a plain image simply does not have.",

When it has many pages, In1 renders each one and bundles them all into a single ZIP archive so you can download everything in one click instead of saving images one at a time. The files inside are numbered in order with zero-padded names, so they sort correctly and you never lose track of which page is which. Whether you are turning a single certificate into an image or exploding a fifty-page report into fifty pictures, the workflow is the same: add the file, click convert, and get back exactly the images you need in the most convenient package for the job.",

That means what you see in the image closely matches how the page looks in a real PDF viewer — fonts render properly, layouts stay intact, and graphics come through cleanly. Pages are rendered at an increased scale for extra sharpness, so the resulting JPGs look good both on screen and when dropped into a printed document, presentation or web page. Rendering on a high-resolution canvas keeps fine print and thin lines readable rather than fuzzy.",

Designers and marketers grab page images to use as previews, thumbnails or mockups. Teachers turn worksheet pages into images for slides. Anyone building a website might convert PDF pages to images to display them inline without forcing visitors to download a file. And sometimes you simply need a quick visual of a document to share at a glance. In every case the aim is the same: get clean, ready-to-use images out of a PDF — quickly, privately and for free. It is the natural counterpart to the image-to-PDF workflow: where one bundles pictures into a document, this one unpacks a document back into pictures, so together they let you move freely between the two formats depending on what a given platform or person expects. Keeping both within reach means you are never stuck because something only accepts one format and you happen to have the other.",

Cropping fixes all of that by letting you keep only the part that matters and cut away the rest. With In1 you drag a frame over your image and move or resize it until it sits exactly where you want, with a live preview of what the final picture will look like. A good crop can completely change an image: it tightens the focus on the subject, removes clutter, straightens a lopsided composition, and turns an average snapshot into something that looks deliberate. Whether you are trimming a few pixels off an edge or pulling a tight portrait out of a wide shot, cropping is the single most useful edit there is, and it takes only a few seconds here. It is also non-destructive in spirit: your original file stays exactly as it was on your device, and you download a separate cropped copy, so you can always come back and crop the same photo a different way. That freedom to try a tight square now and a wide banner later, from the very same source image, is what makes cropping such a low-risk, high-impact edit to reach for.",

Locking the ratio guarantees the crop comes out at exactly the proportion the target expects, so your image is never rejected or awkwardly stretched by the platform afterward. Switching between free and fixed modes is instant, which means you can experiment — try a square, then a widescreen version of the same shot — and pick whichever framing works best without starting over.",

In every case the goal is the same: keep the part of the picture that works, drop the part that doesn't, and get a clean result at the right proportions — quickly, privately and for free.

Email providers bounce attachments over a size limit, upload forms reject files that are too large, and cloud storage fills up faster than it should. The biggest offenders are usually scanned documents and image-heavy files, where every page is essentially a high-resolution photo. Compressing the PDF brings the size down so it actually fits where you need it to go. In1 works by re-rendering each page at a sensible resolution and re-encoding it, which is especially effective on scans and PDFs built from photos — exactly the files that tend to be too big in the first place. After compressing, you see the original size, the new size and the percentage saved, so you know immediately whether the result is small enough for that email, portal or storage limit you were fighting with. The savings on a chunky scan can be dramatic — it is common to see a bloated multi-megabyte document drop to a fraction of its original weight — which is often the difference between an attachment that bounces and one that sends on the first try. And because the comparison is shown every time, you are never guessing: you can immediately tell whether one more pass at a lower quality is worth it or whether you are already comfortably under the limit.",

Because the tool reports the before-and-after sizes every time, you can try a setting, see the result, and adjust until you hit the sweet spot for your particular file.

To protect you from that, In1 only hands back the compressed file when it is actually smaller than the original; if your PDF is already well optimized, it tells you so and keeps your original untouched.

Busy backgrounds that share colors with the subject can also confuse the model. For most everyday photos none of this is an issue, but if a particular image comes out imperfect, trying a clearer photo of the same subject usually helps. Think of it as an excellent, instant first pass that nails the great majority of images — and does it privately, on your device, for free. If you plan to place the cut-out on a busy scene, small soft edges often disappear against the new background anyway, so a result that looks slightly imperfect on the checkerboard can look perfectly clean once it is composited.

Converting MP4 to MP3 strips away the picture and keeps the soundtrack as a compact audio file you can play anywhere — in a music app, on a phone during a commute, in the car, or on a smart speaker. In1 reads the video, extracts its audio track and re-encodes it as an MP3 in a single step. There is nothing to configure beyond the quality you want, and because MP3 is the most universally supported audio format on the planet, the result will play on essentially any device or app without compatibility headaches. Stripping the video also shrinks the file dramatically — audio is a small fraction of a video's size — which makes the MP3 far easier to store on a phone, attach to a message, or sync to a player. And once it is audio-only, you can listen with the screen off, something a video file will not let you do, which is exactly what you want for a podcast or a long lecture you plan to play in the background.",

A higher bitrate like 256 or 320 kbps keeps the audio crisp and is the right pick for music or anything where sound quality matters. A lower bitrate like 128 kbps produces a much smaller file that is perfect for spoken-word content such as podcasts, lectures and interviews, where ultra-high fidelity is unnecessary and a small file is more convenient to store and share. The default sits in the middle at a balanced setting that sounds good for almost everything. Being able to pick the bitrate means you are never stuck with a needlessly huge file for a simple voice recording, or a low-quality file for your favorite track.",

With In1 there is no upload, no account, no watermark on the output and no daily limit.

WAV is uncompressed, lossless audio — large, but perfect when you need maximum quality or a format that audio editors and many devices accept without fuss. OGG (Vorbis) is a free, open format that often sounds better than MP3 at the same size and is common in games and on the web. M4A (AAC) is the format favored across the Apple ecosystem and many modern devices, offering great quality at small sizes. In1 converts freely between all four, so whether a website only accepts MP3, an editor wants WAV, or a device prefers M4A, you can get your audio into exactly the right format in seconds — without hunting for a desktop program or trusting an upload site. Understanding the difference helps you choose well: the lossy formats (MP3, OGG, M4A) discard inaudible detail to stay small, while WAV keeps every sample. Converting a lossy file to WAV will not restore quality that was already removed — it just makes a bigger file — so the best results come from starting with the highest-quality source you have and converting outward to whatever each destination needs.",

Pick OGG when you want strong quality at a small size and the target supports it, which is typical for web apps and game engines. Go with M4A when you are working in the Apple world or want efficient, high-quality compression on modern hardware.

On top of those everyday styles it also handles the conventions programmers rely on — camelCase, snake_case and kebab-case — which are tedious to produce manually. You paste your text once and switch between styles with a single click, seeing the result immediately. Whether you accidentally left Caps Lock on, pasted a heading that came through in all capitals, or need to reformat a list of labels, the right transformation is one tap away instead of a frustrating manual rewrite.",

A case converter fixes all of this in seconds: drop the text in, choose the case you want, and copy the corrected version straight back out. Sentence case is particularly handy for rescuing a wall of capitals into normal prose, while Title Case instantly smartens up a heading that came through flat. Because the conversion is deterministic and instant, you can clean up anything from a single label to a long document without touching the keyboard, and the original meaning is preserved — only the capitalization changes.

The programming styles remove the spaces between words and join them: camelCase lowercases the first word and capitalizes each following word with no separators (myVariableName); snake_case lowercases everything and joins words with underscores (my_variable_name); and kebab-case does the same but joins with hyphens (my-variable-name), which is the standard for URL slugs and CSS classes. Because you can flip between all of them on the same input, it is easy to compare and grab exactly the format a particular destination expects — a headline, a sentence, or a code identifier — without memorizing any of the rules yourself. A handy workflow is to type a name in plain words once and then sample each style in turn: the same phrase can become a Title Case heading, a snake_case database column and a kebab-case URL slug in a few clicks, with no risk of a mistyped capital or a missed separator along the way.",

You can also pick a color visually with the built-in color picker and read off its values, or paste a value and see exactly what it looks like.

        body: "A hash is a fixed-length fingerprint of some data: feed in any text and a hashing algorithm produces a short string that is practically unique to that exact input. Change a single character and the hash changes completely. In1 computes the four hashes you are most likely to need — MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 — all at once, the moment you type, so you can grab whichever one a particular system expects. Each result appears in standard hexadecimal and can be copied with a single click. Generating hashes by hand is impossible, and command-line tools are not always at hand, so having all four in one place in the browser is genuinely convenient. Whether you need a quick checksum to compare two pieces of text, a SHA-256 digest to paste into a config or a verification field, or just want to see how hashing works, the values are right there as fast as you can type the input.",

That means the SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 digests are computed by trusted, well-tested native code rather than a hand-rolled script, so you can rely on the output being correct and standards-compliant. MD5, which the Web Crypto API deliberately does not include because it is considered cryptographically broken, is computed by a dedicated, widely-used library. The result is that all four algorithms produce exactly the hashes you would get from standard command-line tools or server-side libraries, letting you verify checksums and digests with confidence. Because it leans on the platform's own crypto, hashing is also extremely fast, handling everything from a short string to a large block of text in an instant. The text is always treated as UTF-8 before hashing, which is what makes the results match other standard tools exactly — the same string produces the same hash here as it would from a shell command or a server library, including for accented characters, non-Latin scripts and emoji.",

The hashes are generated the instant you type, with no network round trip, which also means the tool works offline and stays fast no matter how much text you hash. This local-only approach is exactly what you want from a hashing tool: you get the convenience of an online utility without the danger of handing potentially sensitive input to a third party.

        body: "Hashes show up all over computing. The most common use is integrity checking: a file or message is hashed, and anyone can re-hash it later to confirm it has not changed, since even a tiny edit produces a completely different hash. Developers compare hashes to detect duplicate or modified content, generate cache keys and ETags, and create deterministic identifiers from input. SHA-256 in particular underpins countless systems, from software release checksums to blockchains and digital signatures. Hashes are also used to index data and to fingerprint values without storing the original. It is worth knowing what hashing is not: it is one-way, so you cannot reverse a hash back into the original text, and on its own it is not encryption. MD5 and SHA-1 in particular should be treated as checksums for non-security uses, since both are considered weak for cryptographic purposes today.",

QA and DevOps engineers confirm that a downloaded artifact's checksum matches the one published by its author. Security-minded users hash values to compare them without exposing the originals. Students learning about cryptography and data structures use it to see hashing in action and understand how a small input change cascades into a totally different output. Even non-developers occasionally need a quick MD5 or SHA-256 to paste into a form, a tool or a verification field. Whatever the reason, the need is the same: turn some text into a standard MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash, and do it quickly, privately and for free, without installing anything or trusting a server with the input. Having all four algorithms generated side by side is part of the appeal: you do not need to remember a command's flags or switch tools to compare, say, an MD5 checksum against a SHA-256 digest — you paste once and read off whichever the task in front of you happens to require.",

Rotating the PDF fixes this permanently so the file looks right everywhere — on screen, when shared, and when printed. In1 lets you turn the pages by a quarter (90°), a half (180°) or three-quarters (270°) of a full turn, which covers every orientation problem a scan or export can produce. Instead of living with a document that is annoying to read or re-scanning the whole thing, you correct it in a couple of clicks and download a clean version. The rotation is baked into the file itself, so the corrected orientation sticks no matter what app or device opens it next. This is different from simply turning the view in a reader, which only affects how you see it on screen and reverts the moment someone else opens the file — here the change travels with the document, so the person you send it to, and the printer you send it to, both get it the right way up.",

The rotation is also relative to each page's current orientation, so it does the sensible thing even on files where pages already carry some rotation. For the common case — a batch scan that all came in sideways — you simply choose 90° or 270° depending on which way it needs to turn, click rotate, and the whole file is fixed instantly.

The file size barely changes, and there is no generation loss from re-encoding. This matters when the PDF is something you will keep working with: a contract you still need to search, a report you will print, or a document you will combine with others later.

In1 lets you type whatever text you want — CONFIDENTIAL, DRAFT, COPY, a company name, a person's name, a date — and stamps it across the entire PDF in one step. It is the fastest way to signal intent before you send a file out: a draft contract that should not be acted on yet, an internal report that must not circulate, or a proof you are sharing for review. The message rides along with the document, so anyone who opens it understands its status immediately. Because the watermark sits over the content rather than replacing it, the document remains fully usable — readable, printable and shareable — while carrying its label everywhere it goes. That combination of clear signalling and untouched content is exactly why a diagonal text watermark has become the standard way to mark drafts, copies and confidential material.",

The watermark is sized and angled to span each page diagonally, which is the classic, professional look and the hardest to crop out or ignore.

The text is drawn directly into the PDF as part of each page, so it travels with the file: it shows up when the document is opened in any reader, when it is shared, and when it is printed.

In1 makes this simple: you set a start time and an end time, and the tool produces a new video containing only that section. It is perfect for grabbing a highlight from a longer recording, removing the boring beginning and end of a screen capture, or isolating the exact few seconds you want to send. Because you keep only the portion you choose, the resulting file is also smaller and quicker to upload or message — you are sending the moment, not the whole reel. Setting a precise start and end also means you do not have to rely on whoever watches it to skip ahead; the clip simply begins where the interesting part begins and ends where it ends, which is exactly what a viewer expects from something shared deliberately rather than a raw recording dumped in full.",

Instead of re-encoding the whole video — which is slow, especially in the browser — it copies the existing audio and video streams directly into the new clip, simply discarding everything outside your chosen range. That means trimming is dramatically faster than a full conversion and there is no loss of quality at all, since the original frames and audio are passed through untouched. The trade-off worth knowing about is that, to keep this speed and quality, the cut snaps to the nearest keyframe near your start point, so the clip may begin a fraction of a second from the exact time you typed. For the vast majority of uses that is imperceptible, and in return you get a near-instant, lossless trim instead of a long wait while every frame is rebuilt.",

WebM is a free, open format designed for the web that often produces smaller files and is preferred by some web apps and platforms. In1 converts between the two so you can take a WebM that will not open in your editor and turn it into an MP4, or convert an MP4 into a lighter WebM for embedding on a page.

To keep things responsive and avoid running out of memory, there is a sensible size limit on the file you can load, and very large or long videos are better handled by a desktop application. We use a fast encoder preset so the wait stays reasonable, and a progress bar keeps you informed throughout.

You pick the part of the clip to capture and a few quality settings, and the tool produces a ready-to-use animated GIF. Because a GIF needs no audio track and no player controls, it is often the friendliest way to share a brief moving image — it just plays, everywhere, the instant it loads. For short, silent, looping moments, a GIF communicates faster than asking someone to click play on a video. And because GIFs are treated as images rather than media, they slip into places a video file often cannot go — an issue comment, a wiki page, a chat that does not embed players, or an email — and start moving the instant they appear, with no thumbnail to tap and no controls to fumble with.",

The width sets the dimensions of the GIF; a smaller size keeps it light for chat and email, while a larger one shows more detail. And because GIFs balloon in size with every extra second, you choose a start point and a short duration to capture, keeping the result manageable. Together these three settings let you dial in exactly the GIF you want: a tiny, snappy reaction loop, or a slightly larger, smoother demo. Seeing how the choices affect the output helps you find the sweet spot between looking good and staying small enough to share.",

A few seconds at a modest size produces a shareable file; a long, high-frame-rate, full-size GIF can be enormous — far larger than the original video — and slow to load. That is why In1 focuses on short captures with adjustable quality, so you get a GIF that is actually practical to send and embed. If you need a long clip with sound, a video format is the right tool; but for a brief, silent, looping moment that needs to play instantly and everywhere, a compact GIF is exactly right, and keeping it short is what keeps it usable.",

Seeing the two figures side by side lets you match whichever rule applies without recounting by hand or pasting your text into another program.

'Keep paragraphs' is the smart option for documents: it flattens the lines inside each paragraph but preserves the blank line between paragraphs, so a multi-section article stays readable instead of collapsing into one giant wall of text. You can switch between the modes and watch the result update immediately, picking whichever output matches what you are pasting the text into next.",

In1 tidies that up as part of the same pass. When it joins lines, it collapses the runs of extra spaces and tabs that tend to accumulate at the seams down to single spaces, and it trims whitespace from the ends, so the output reads as if it had been typed cleanly in the first place. In the 'Keep paragraphs' mode it also drops empty stretches so you do not end up with three or four blank lines between sections. The goal is text you can paste straight into a document, a form, a chat message or a content management system without a second round of find-and-replace to fix the spacing the line breaks left behind. That single combined pass — breaks handled and spacing normalized together — is what separates a genuinely useful cleanup from one that simply trades one formatting problem for another.",

Remove Duplicate Lines does it in one pass. It reads your list line by line, keeps the first occurrence of each unique line and discards every later repeat, then shows you the cleaned result along with a count of how many duplicates it removed.

'Reverse line order' leaves every line untouched but flips the top-to-bottom sequence, turning a list that runs first-to-last into one that runs last-to-first.

A good slug is lowercase, uses hyphens instead of spaces, contains only safe characters and reads clearly to both people and search engines. Getting it right matters more than it first appears. Clean, descriptive slugs are easier to read, share and remember, they look trustworthy when pasted into a message, and they give search engines another clear signal about what a page is about, which can help with ranking and click-through. Messy slugs full of spaces, capital letters, accents or punctuation get percent-encoded into unreadable strings, break in some systems, and look unprofessional. This tool takes any title and produces a slug that follows all the conventions automatically, so you do not have to remember the rules or clean each one up by hand.",

Punctuation and symbols that have no place in a clean URL are removed. Runs of spaces, hyphens and underscores are collapsed into a single separator, and any separators left dangling at the start or end are trimmed away. The result is a tidy slug with no surprises. Because every transformation happens as you type, you can watch a title turn into its slug in real time and immediately see the effect of your wording, which makes it easy to tweak a title until the slug reads exactly the way you want it to.",

You can also choose whether to force everything to lowercase — the safest and most common option, since URLs are often case-sensitive and mixed casing can lead to duplicate-looking links — or preserve the original capitalization when you specifically need it. The options update the output instantly, so you can compare styles at a glance and pick the one that fits where the slug is going. Sensible defaults mean that for most people the tool produces exactly the right result without touching any settings at all, while the options are there the moment a specific platform or house style needs something different.",

This turns what could be dozens of individual conversions into a single instant operation, which is a real time-saver for bloggers, developers and anyone migrating or bulk-creating content. The order is preserved so you can line the slugs up against your original titles, and because everything runs locally there is no limit on how many lines you can convert at once beyond what your own device handles, which in practice means very long lists are no problem.",

Developers wire slugs into routing and file names, e-commerce teams generate product handles in bulk, and documentation authors keep anchor links tidy and predictable.

In1 generates as much or as little of it as you need on demand. Instead of copying the same tired paragraph from somewhere and pasting it over and over to fill a space, you choose the amount you want and get a fresh block instantly, sized to your layout.

Choose words when you need to fill a precise, short space such as a headline, a button label, a menu item or a meta field, where the exact length matters more than the shape.

Other times you would rather the filler start with varied text so it does not always look identical, especially when you are generating several separate blocks on the same page. In1 lets you toggle the classic opening on or off to suit the situation. When it is on, your text leads with the canonical phrase; when it is off, you get freshly assembled filler from the first word.

Print and graphic designers flow dummy text into brochures, posters and layouts to evaluate typography. Writers and editors use it to block out the structure of a document before the words are ready. Marketers and product teams populate wireframes for reviews and presentations. Students learning design or development use it while practicing layouts. Anyone who has ever needed 'some text, any text' to see how a design looks when it is not empty benefits from a generator that produces the right amount on demand, in the unit they need, without hunting for a paragraph to copy. Agencies fill client mockups before the copywriting is signed off, app developers seed demo screens for screenshots, and teachers create sample passages for typography and reading exercises. Generating fresh filler each time also avoids the oddly distracting effect of seeing the exact same placeholder paragraph repeated across every block of a page, which keeps a mockup feeling like a real, varied design rather than a template stuffed with one cloned sentence.",

In1 also shows a count of additions and removals, giving you an instant sense of how big the change really is.

Word-by-word comparison drills deeper, highlighting the specific words that changed within otherwise similar text, which is what you want when two paragraphs are mostly the same and you need to pinpoint the exact edits inside them. You can switch between the modes instantly and watch the highlighting change, so it is easy to start with a line-level overview to see the shape of the change and then drop to word level to examine a particular passage in detail.

Comparing the before and after versions surfaces every difference, so you can verify that the edits are exactly the ones you meant to make and nothing slipped in unnoticed. It is equally useful in the other direction: when someone hands you a revised document, a diff shows you precisely what they touched instead of forcing you to re-read the whole thing looking for changes.

Converting by hand is tedious and error-prone, especially for anything with nested lists, links, code blocks or tables. This tool does it in an instant. You paste your Markdown and it produces clean, correct HTML that you can copy straight into a page, a template or a content management system.

Seeing the live preview before copying means there is never a surprise when the HTML lands on the page, because the rendered result you approved in the tool is the same structure that gets pasted, which removes the usual round of fixing markup after the fact.",

      {
        heading: "Write and preview, side by side",
        body: "The best way to write Markdown is to see it taking shape as you go, and that is exactly what a split-screen editor gives you. You type in the panel on the left and the panel on the right shows your text rendered the way it will actually appear, updating with every keystroke. There is no separate 'preview' button to click and no mental translation required between the symbols you type and the formatting they produce. Add a heading and it appears, styled, the instant you type the hash; start a list and watch it indent; paste a link and see it become clickable. This immediate feedback makes writing Markdown faster and far more pleasant, especially for longer documents where small formatting mistakes are easy to miss in raw text. Instead of writing, switching context to check, and switching back, you stay in a single flow with the finished look always visible beside your words.",
      },
      {
        heading: "GitHub-flavored Markdown, fully rendered",
        body: "The editor supports GitHub-flavored Markdown, the dialect most people actually write, so the preview reflects the full range of formatting you use rather than a stripped-down subset. Headings, bold and italic, ordered and unordered lists, links, images, blockquotes, horizontal rules, inline code and fenced code blocks all render the way you expect, and tables built from pipes and dashes are drawn with proper borders. Line breaks behave sensibly, so the text you write reads the same in the preview as it does in your head. Because the rendering matches the conventions used in README files, documentation and notes apps, what you compose here will look the same when you take it elsewhere. That consistency is the whole point of a preview: it is only useful if you can trust that the rendered result you see is the result you will get when the Markdown is published or pasted into another GFM-aware system.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Copy the Markdown or the HTML",
        body: "When your document is ready, you need to get it out of the editor, and how you want it depends on where it is going. Sometimes you want the Markdown itself — to commit a README, paste into an issue, save a note, or hand to another Markdown-aware system. Other times you need the rendered HTML — to drop into a web page, an email template or a CMS that expects markup. In1 lets you copy either with a single click: grab the raw Markdown from the editor side, or copy the generated HTML from the preview side. You are never locked into one format or forced to run the text through a second tool to get the other. This dual output makes the editor useful both as a comfortable place to write Markdown and as a quick way to turn that Markdown into publishable HTML, covering the two things people most often need to do with it.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Private by design — nothing leaves your browser",
        body: "Whatever you are writing — documentation, a draft post, private notes, a README for an unreleased project — it stays on your own device. In1's Markdown editor runs entirely in your browser using plain JavaScript, so neither your Markdown nor the rendered HTML is ever uploaded to a server. There is no account to create, no document stored in the cloud and nothing left behind when you close the tab. The preview and both copy actions work with no network request, which means the editor is instant and fully functional offline — you can write on a plane or behind a firewall and it behaves exactly the same. This local-only design is what makes it safe to draft sensitive or unpublished content here, and it is also what keeps the experience fast and reliable: there is no syncing, no loading and no failure mode tied to your connection. You just write, and the preview keeps up.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Who uses an online Markdown editor?",
        body: "Plenty of people write Markdown but do not always have their preferred editor open. Developers draft README files, documentation and issue descriptions and want to see them rendered before committing or posting. Technical writers compose docs in Markdown for its speed and clarity. Bloggers and content creators write posts in Markdown and need to preview them and grab the HTML for their platform. Students and researchers take structured notes in Markdown and like seeing them formatted. Open-source maintainers polish project pages. Anyone jotting something down who wants clean formatting without wrestling with a word processor reaches for Markdown, and a browser-based editor with a live preview means they can do it anywhere, on any device, without installing anything. Being able to copy either the Markdown or the HTML at the end makes it a practical one-stop tool: a comfortable place to write and an instant way to publish what you wrote. It is equally handy for quick one-off tasks — formatting a comment, drafting release notes, or cleaning up a snippet someone sent you — where opening a full application would be overkill. Because the preview is always visible beside the text, even people who do not write Markdown often can experiment, see what each symbol does, and learn the syntax by watching it render in real time rather than memorizing rules.",
