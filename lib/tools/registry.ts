        body: "The passwords people invent themselves are far weaker than they feel. Names, dates, favorite teams and predictable substitutions like 'P@ssw0rd' are exactly what attackers try first, and reused passwords mean a single leak can unlock dozens of accounts. A randomly generated password has no pattern to guess: every character is independent, so the only way to break it is brute force, which becomes astronomically slow as length grows. Generating a fresh random password for each account — and storing it in a password manager — is the single most effective habit for keeping your online life secure. Most large-scale account takeovers don't involve some clever hack at all; they happen because a password leaked from one breached site is quietly tried against email, banking and social accounts elsewhere. A unique random password per account breaks that chain completely, so even if one service is compromised, the damage stops there instead of spreading across your whole digital life.",

In1 instead uses the Web Crypto API — specifically crypto.getRandomValues() — the same cryptographically secure random source browsers use for sensitive operations. That means the characters in your password are drawn from a high-quality, unpredictable entropy source, not a guessable sequence. The generator also makes sure every character type you enable actually appears in the result, so a password meant to include numbers and symbols never comes out missing them by chance. After guaranteeing one character from each selected set, it fills the rest from the combined pool and then shuffles everything, so the required characters aren't predictably parked at the front. The difference between a secure random source and a predictable one is not academic: a password built from a weak generator can sometimes be reproduced by an attacker who knows the algorithm, while one built from real entropy cannot.",

Length is the most powerful: each extra character multiplies the number of possible combinations, so a longer password is exponentially harder to crack. Variety is the second: mixing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols expands the pool each character is chosen from. With In1 you set the exact length with a slider and toggle the four character groups on or off to satisfy whatever rules a particular site enforces. Want a long passphrase-length secret or a short PIN-style code? Both are a couple of clicks away. The live preview regenerates as soon as you change an option, so you can immediately see the effect of adding symbols or stretching the length. Some sites stubbornly reject certain symbols or cap the length, and being able to dial the exact mix means you can always produce a password that is both as strong as possible and actually accepted by the form in front of you.",

This local-only approach removes the biggest risk of online generators — the possibility that the very tool creating your password could be recording it.

Turn on two-factor authentication wherever it is offered for a second layer of defense, ideally with an authenticator app rather than SMS. For the accounts that matter most — email, banking, work — favor longer passwords with all character types enabled, since your email in particular is the master key that can reset many of your other logins.

Pretty-printing makes it far easier to spot a missing field, trace a nested path, or compare two responses.

Once the structure is visible, problems that were hidden in a wall of text jump out: an array where you expected an object, a value that is a string when it should be a number, or a branch that is nested one level deeper than the rest of the payload.

That instant feedback turns 'why won't this parse?' into a quick fix. It is the fastest way to confirm that a payload, config file or copied snippet is valid before you ship it. Common culprits include trailing commas after the last item, single quotes instead of double quotes, missing quotation marks around keys, and unescaped characters inside strings — all of which strict JSON forbids even though they look harmless.

With one click you can switch between a readable, beautified version and a compact, production-ready one. The two operations are perfect complements in a normal workflow: minify a configuration blob before you paste it into an environment variable or a URL, then beautify it again later when you need to read or edit it.

It exists because many systems were built to move plain text reliably but can corrupt or misinterpret raw bytes — think email bodies, URLs, JSON fields, HTML attributes and HTTP headers. By translating data into a compact, text-only alphabet, Base64 lets you embed images, fonts, tokens or arbitrary text inside those text-only channels without anything getting mangled in transit. It does not encrypt or compress — the goal is safe, lossless transport — but it is one of the most common encodings you will meet when working with the web. The name comes from the size of its alphabet: the uppercase and lowercase letters, the digits zero through nine, and two extra symbols, plus a padding character. Every three bytes of input become four Base64 characters, which is why an encoded string is always a bit larger than the original — a deliberate trade of size for safety and compatibility.",

The result appears instantly and can be copied with one click, making it quick to round-trip a value, inspect an encoded token, or prepare data for a system that expects Base64 input. Because the output updates as you type and as you flip modes, it is easy to experiment: paste a suspicious-looking string, switch to decode, and immediately see whether it was Base64 at all. The same convenience helps when you are building a request by hand and need to encode a credential or a small payload without leaving the page.",

In1 encodes through the TextEncoder and decodes through the TextDecoder APIs, which means your text is first converted to proper UTF-8 bytes before encoding and reconstructed faithfully on the way back. Accented characters, non-Latin scripts, symbols and emoji all survive the round trip intact. Whether you are encoding Portuguese, Japanese, mathematical symbols or a string full of emoji, what you decode is exactly what you put in. This is more than a nice-to-have: the classic browser shortcut for Base64 throws an error or silently corrupts data when it meets a character outside the basic Latin range, which is exactly the kind of subtle bug that surfaces only in production with real user input. By handling Unicode correctly from the start, this tool gives you results you can trust regardless of the language or symbols involved.",

You can safely decode a token to inspect its contents or encode a sensitive value, confident that the data stays on your own device the whole time. This point deserves emphasis because Base64 is sometimes mistaken for a security measure, when in reality anyone can decode it in seconds.

Basic authentication headers, email attachments (MIME), and many API parameters all rely on Base64.

Whenever you need data to travel through a text-only channel intact, Base64 is the standard answer. Knowing how to quickly encode and decode it by hand is a small but genuinely useful skill — it turns an opaque string in a log or a config file into something you can actually read and reason about.

Many commercial 'dynamic' QR services hide this distinction, offering editable codes that secretly route through their servers and can be locked behind a subscription you must keep paying to keep your code alive.

JPG is the long-standing choice for photographs, where its compression keeps files small at the cost of some invisible detail. PNG is built for graphics, screenshots, logos and anything that needs crisp edges or a transparent background. WebP is the modern all-rounder that often beats both, producing smaller files at similar quality and supporting transparency too. This converter moves your image freely between all three, so you can take a screenshot saved as a heavy PNG and turn it into a lightweight JPG, modernize an old photo into WebP, or convert a WebP someone sent you into a PNG that every program can open. Picking the right format for the job is one of the simplest ways to make images load faster and behave the way you expect, and doing the conversion takes only a couple of clicks here.",

        body: "JPG and WebP are lossy formats, which means they trade a little visual fidelity for a much smaller file. How much they trade is up to you. When you convert to either format, a quality slider lets you choose the balance that fits your needs: keep it high for photos you want to look pristine, or lower it to squeeze the file down for a fast-loading web page or an email attachment. PNG, by contrast, is lossless, so converting to PNG always preserves every pixel exactly and the quality control simply does not apply. Being able to see and set the quality yourself means you are never stuck with a one-size-fits-all result — you decide whether file size or maximum sharpness matters more for this particular image, and you can try a different setting in seconds if the first one is not quite right.",

So when you convert a transparent PNG to JPG, those see-through regions have to become something solid. This converter fills them with a clean white background rather than leaving them black or producing strange fringing, which is what you almost always want for a logo or graphic that will sit on a page. Going the other way, converting to PNG or WebP keeps any transparency intact, so a graphic stays usable over any background. Understanding this one detail saves a lot of frustration, and the tool applies the sensible default automatically so your converted image looks right without any manual fixing. If you specifically need transparency in your final file, convert to PNG or WebP rather than JPG, and your see-through areas will be preserved exactly. Choosing the destination format with transparency in mind is the single most important decision when converting logos, icons and other graphics that need to float cleanly over a coloured background.",

Whatever the destination, the need is the same: get the picture into the right format, at the right size, without losing control of quality — and do it quickly, privately and for free. A good rule of thumb is to reach for JPG when the image is a photograph, PNG when it has sharp edges or transparency, and WebP when you want the smallest file for the web without giving up much quality.

This resizer lets you type the exact width and height you want and produces an image at those dimensions, no guessing involved. Because the work is done on a canvas at full precision, the output lands on the numbers you asked for.

To prevent that, the resizer keeps the aspect-ratio lock switched on by default: change the width and the height updates automatically to match the original proportions, and vice versa. This way your image is scaled cleanly without any squishing, and you only have to think about one dimension. When you genuinely need a non-proportional size — fitting an image into a fixed box where some distortion is acceptable, or deliberately changing the shape — you can simply turn the lock off and set width and height independently. Having both modes one click apart means you get safe, proportional resizing by default but never lose the flexibility to do something custom when the situation calls for it.",

        heading: "Shrink file size as a bonus",
        body: "Resizing is one of the most effective ways to make an image lighter, because file size is driven far more by pixel dimensions than people expect. A photo straight from a modern phone can be four or five thousand pixels wide — vastly more than any web page or email needs. Scaling it down to a sensible display size like 1200 or 1920 pixels wide can cut the file from several megabytes to a few hundred kilobytes while looking identical on screen, since the extra pixels were never visible at normal viewing sizes anyway. That makes resizing a quick win for faster-loading pages, smoother email attachments and more free space on your device. If you need to squeeze the file even further afterward, you can pair the resizer with a dedicated compressor, but very often resizing alone does the job. As a practical guide, most images shown on a typical screen never need to be wider than about 1920 pixels, and thumbnails or avatars need far less than that. Matching the pixel dimensions to how the image will actually be displayed is the smartest first step, because every pixel you remove that nobody would ever see is pure saved weight with no visible downside at all.",

This tool lets you add as many images as you like and turns each one into its own page, producing a single, self-contained document. It is the natural way to package scanned pages, a set of receipts, a batch of photos, screenshots of a conversation, or pictures of a handwritten form — anything that makes more sense as one ordered file than as a pile of separate images scattered across a folder. A PDF also travels far better than raw images: it keeps your pages in a fixed order, prints predictably, and opens the same way whether the recipient is on a phone, a laptop or a library computer. Image files, by contrast, can be reordered by a file manager, stripped of their sequence by an email client, or opened in a viewer that only shows one at a time, which is exactly the kind of friction a single PDF removes.",

The order you see on screen is the order of the pages in the finished PDF, so there are no surprises when you open the result. That control is essential for things like multi-page scans, where page two must follow page one, or a photo story that needs to read in a particular sequence.

In1 draws every page at a high resolution so text stays crisp and details remain legible rather than coming out blurry or pixelated. A one-page PDF gives you a single JPG, while a multi-page document produces one image per page, neatly numbered. Because JPG is universally supported, the result opens instantly on any phone, computer or app, with no special reader required — which is exactly what makes images so much more convenient than PDFs in these situations. An image is also far easier to embed and preview: messaging apps and social platforms show it inline automatically, content editors place it like any other picture, and a thumbnail can be generated from it without extra tooling. A PDF, by contrast, usually shows up as a file attachment that the viewer has to deliberately open, which adds a step that a plain image simply does not have.",

        body: "The tool adapts to the size of your document. When your PDF has a single page, you get that page back as one JPG, ready to download immediately. When it has many pages, In1 renders each one and bundles them all into a single ZIP archive so you can download everything in one click instead of saving images one at a time. The files inside are numbered in order with zero-padded names, so they sort correctly and you never lose track of which page is which. Whether you are turning a single certificate into an image or exploding a fifty-page report into fifty pictures, the workflow is the same: add the file, click convert, and get back exactly the images you need in the most convenient package for the job.",

In1 uses pdf.js, the same mature, open-source rendering engine that powers PDF viewing in major web browsers, to draw each page onto a canvas before exporting it as a JPG. That means what you see in the image closely matches how the page looks in a real PDF viewer — fonts render properly, layouts stay intact, and graphics come through cleanly. Pages are rendered at an increased scale for extra sharpness, so the resulting JPGs look good both on screen and when dropped into a printed document, presentation or web page. Rendering on a high-resolution canvas keeps fine print and thin lines readable rather than fuzzy.",

Not a single byte is uploaded, stored or logged, and there is no account to create.

Designers and marketers grab page images to use as previews, thumbnails or mockups. Teachers turn worksheet pages into images for slides. Anyone building a website might convert PDF pages to images to display them inline without forcing visitors to download a file. And sometimes you simply need a quick visual of a document to share at a glance. In every case the aim is the same: get clean, ready-to-use images out of a PDF — quickly, privately and for free. It is the natural counterpart to the image-to-PDF workflow: where one bundles pictures into a document, this one unpacks a document back into pictures, so together they let you move freely between the two formats depending on what a given platform or person expects. Keeping both within reach means you are never stuck because something only accepts one format and you happen to have the other.",

Cropping fixes all of that by letting you keep only the part that matters and cut away the rest. With In1 you drag a frame over your image and move or resize it until it sits exactly where you want, with a live preview of what the final picture will look like. A good crop can completely change an image: it tightens the focus on the subject, removes clutter, straightens a lopsided composition, and turns an average snapshot into something that looks deliberate. Whether you are trimming a few pixels off an edge or pulling a tight portrait out of a wide shot, cropping is the single most useful edit there is, and it takes only a few seconds here. It is also non-destructive in spirit: your original file stays exactly as it was on your device, and you download a separate cropped copy, so you can always come back and crop the same photo a different way. That freedom to try a tight square now and a wide banner later, from the very same source image, is what makes cropping such a low-risk, high-impact edit to reach for.",

Locking the ratio guarantees the crop comes out at exactly the proportion the target expects, so your image is never rejected or awkwardly stretched by the platform afterward. Switching between free and fixed modes is instant, which means you can experiment — try a square, then a widescreen version of the same shot — and pick whichever framing works best without starting over.",

In every case the goal is the same: keep the part of the picture that works, drop the part that doesn't, and get a clean result at the right proportions — quickly, privately and for free.

Email providers bounce attachments over a size limit, upload forms reject files that are too large, and cloud storage fills up faster than it should. The biggest offenders are usually scanned documents and image-heavy files, where every page is essentially a high-resolution photo. Compressing the PDF brings the size down so it actually fits where you need it to go. In1 works by re-rendering each page at a sensible resolution and re-encoding it, which is especially effective on scans and PDFs built from photos — exactly the files that tend to be too big in the first place. After compressing, you see the original size, the new size and the percentage saved, so you know immediately whether the result is small enough for that email, portal or storage limit you were fighting with. The savings on a chunky scan can be dramatic — it is common to see a bloated multi-megabyte document drop to a fraction of its original weight — which is often the difference between an attachment that bounces and one that sends on the first try. And because the comparison is shown every time, you are never guessing: you can immediately tell whether one more pass at a lower quality is worth it or whether you are already comfortably under the limit.",

Because the tool reports the before-and-after sizes every time, you can try a setting, see the result, and adjust until you hit the sweet spot for your particular file.

To protect you from that, In1 only hands back the compressed file when it is actually smaller than the original; if your PDF is already well optimized, it tells you so and keeps your original untouched.

Busy backgrounds that share colors with the subject can also confuse the model. For most everyday photos none of this is an issue, but if a particular image comes out imperfect, trying a clearer photo of the same subject usually helps. Think of it as an excellent, instant first pass that nails the great majority of images — and does it privately, on your device, for free. If you plan to place the cut-out on a busy scene, small soft edges often disappear against the new background anyway, so a result that looks slightly imperfect on the checkerboard can look perfectly clean once it is composited.

Converting MP4 to MP3 strips away the picture and keeps the soundtrack as a compact audio file you can play anywhere — in a music app, on a phone during a commute, in the car, or on a smart speaker. In1 reads the video, extracts its audio track and re-encodes it as an MP3 in a single step. There is nothing to configure beyond the quality you want, and because MP3 is the most universally supported audio format on the planet, the result will play on essentially any device or app without compatibility headaches. Stripping the video also shrinks the file dramatically — audio is a small fraction of a video's size — which makes the MP3 far easier to store on a phone, attach to a message, or sync to a player. And once it is audio-only, you can listen with the screen off, something a video file will not let you do, which is exactly what you want for a podcast or a long lecture you plan to play in the background.",

A higher bitrate like 256 or 320 kbps keeps the audio crisp and is the right pick for music or anything where sound quality matters. A lower bitrate like 128 kbps produces a much smaller file that is perfect for spoken-word content such as podcasts, lectures and interviews, where ultra-high fidelity is unnecessary and a small file is more convenient to store and share. The default sits in the middle at a balanced setting that sounds good for almost everything. Being able to pick the bitrate means you are never stuck with a needlessly huge file for a simple voice recording, or a low-quality file for your favorite track.",

With In1 there is no upload, no account, no watermark on the output and no daily limit.

WAV is uncompressed, lossless audio — large, but perfect when you need maximum quality or a format that audio editors and many devices accept without fuss. OGG (Vorbis) is a free, open format that often sounds better than MP3 at the same size and is common in games and on the web. M4A (AAC) is the format favored across the Apple ecosystem and many modern devices, offering great quality at small sizes. In1 converts freely between all four, so whether a website only accepts MP3, an editor wants WAV, or a device prefers M4A, you can get your audio into exactly the right format in seconds — without hunting for a desktop program or trusting an upload site. Understanding the difference helps you choose well: the lossy formats (MP3, OGG, M4A) discard inaudible detail to stay small, while WAV keeps every sample. Converting a lossy file to WAV will not restore quality that was already removed — it just makes a bigger file — so the best results come from starting with the highest-quality source you have and converting outward to whatever each destination needs.",

Pick OGG when you want strong quality at a small size and the target supports it, which is typical for web apps and game engines. Go with M4A when you are working in the Apple world or want efficient, high-quality compression on modern hardware.

On top of those everyday styles it also handles the conventions programmers rely on — camelCase, snake_case and kebab-case — which are tedious to produce manually. You paste your text once and switch between styles with a single click, seeing the result immediately. Whether you accidentally left Caps Lock on, pasted a heading that came through in all capitals, or need to reformat a list of labels, the right transformation is one tap away instead of a frustrating manual rewrite.",

A case converter fixes all of this in seconds: drop the text in, choose the case you want, and copy the corrected version straight back out. Sentence case is particularly handy for rescuing a wall of capitals into normal prose, while Title Case instantly smartens up a heading that came through flat. Because the conversion is deterministic and instant, you can clean up anything from a single label to a long document without touching the keyboard, and the original meaning is preserved — only the capitalization changes.

The programming styles remove the spaces between words and join them: camelCase lowercases the first word and capitalizes each following word with no separators (myVariableName); snake_case lowercases everything and joins words with underscores (my_variable_name); and kebab-case does the same but joins with hyphens (my-variable-name), which is the standard for URL slugs and CSS classes. Because you can flip between all of them on the same input, it is easy to compare and grab exactly the format a particular destination expects — a headline, a sentence, or a code identifier — without memorizing any of the rules yourself. A handy workflow is to type a name in plain words once and then sample each style in turn: the same phrase can become a Title Case heading, a snake_case database column and a kebab-case URL slug in a few clicks, with no risk of a mistyped capital or a missed separator along the way.",

You can also pick a color visually with the built-in color picker and read off its values, or paste a value and see exactly what it looks like.

        body: "A hash is a fixed-length fingerprint of some data: feed in any text and a hashing algorithm produces a short string that is practically unique to that exact input. Change a single character and the hash changes completely. In1 computes the four hashes you are most likely to need — MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 — all at once, the moment you type, so you can grab whichever one a particular system expects. Each result appears in standard hexadecimal and can be copied with a single click. Generating hashes by hand is impossible, and command-line tools are not always at hand, so having all four in one place in the browser is genuinely convenient. Whether you need a quick checksum to compare two pieces of text, a SHA-256 digest to paste into a config or a verification field, or just want to see how hashing works, the values are right there as fast as you can type the input.",

That means the SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 digests are computed by trusted, well-tested native code rather than a hand-rolled script, so you can rely on the output being correct and standards-compliant. MD5, which the Web Crypto API deliberately does not include because it is considered cryptographically broken, is computed by a dedicated, widely-used library. The result is that all four algorithms produce exactly the hashes you would get from standard command-line tools or server-side libraries, letting you verify checksums and digests with confidence. Because it leans on the platform's own crypto, hashing is also extremely fast, handling everything from a short string to a large block of text in an instant. The text is always treated as UTF-8 before hashing, which is what makes the results match other standard tools exactly — the same string produces the same hash here as it would from a shell command or a server library, including for accented characters, non-Latin scripts and emoji.",

The hashes are generated the instant you type, with no network round trip, which also means the tool works offline and stays fast no matter how much text you hash. This local-only approach is exactly what you want from a hashing tool: you get the convenience of an online utility without the danger of handing potentially sensitive input to a third party.

        body: "Hashes show up all over computing. The most common use is integrity checking: a file or message is hashed, and anyone can re-hash it later to confirm it has not changed, since even a tiny edit produces a completely different hash. Developers compare hashes to detect duplicate or modified content, generate cache keys and ETags, and create deterministic identifiers from input. SHA-256 in particular underpins countless systems, from software release checksums to blockchains and digital signatures. Hashes are also used to index data and to fingerprint values without storing the original. It is worth knowing what hashing is not: it is one-way, so you cannot reverse a hash back into the original text, and on its own it is not encryption. MD5 and SHA-1 in particular should be treated as checksums for non-security uses, since both are considered weak for cryptographic purposes today.",

QA and DevOps engineers confirm that a downloaded artifact's checksum matches the one published by its author. Security-minded users hash values to compare them without exposing the originals. Students learning about cryptography and data structures use it to see hashing in action and understand how a small input change cascades into a totally different output. Even non-developers occasionally need a quick MD5 or SHA-256 to paste into a form, a tool or a verification field. Whatever the reason, the need is the same: turn some text into a standard MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash, and do it quickly, privately and for free, without installing anything or trusting a server with the input. Having all four algorithms generated side by side is part of the appeal: you do not need to remember a command's flags or switch tools to compare, say, an MD5 checksum against a SHA-256 digest — you paste once and read off whichever the task in front of you happens to require.",

Rotating the PDF fixes this permanently so the file looks right everywhere — on screen, when shared, and when printed. In1 lets you turn the pages by a quarter (90°), a half (180°) or three-quarters (270°) of a full turn, which covers every orientation problem a scan or export can produce. Instead of living with a document that is annoying to read or re-scanning the whole thing, you correct it in a couple of clicks and download a clean version. The rotation is baked into the file itself, so the corrected orientation sticks no matter what app or device opens it next. This is different from simply turning the view in a reader, which only affects how you see it on screen and reverts the moment someone else opens the file — here the change travels with the document, so the person you send it to, and the printer you send it to, both get it the right way up.",

The rotation is also relative to each page's current orientation, so it does the sensible thing even on files where pages already carry some rotation. For the common case — a batch scan that all came in sideways — you simply choose 90° or 270° depending on which way it needs to turn, click rotate, and the whole file is fixed instantly.

The file size barely changes, and there is no generation loss from re-encoding. This matters when the PDF is something you will keep working with: a contract you still need to search, a report you will print, or a document you will combine with others later.

In1 lets you type whatever text you want — CONFIDENTIAL, DRAFT, COPY, a company name, a person's name, a date — and stamps it across the entire PDF in one step. It is the fastest way to signal intent before you send a file out: a draft contract that should not be acted on yet, an internal report that must not circulate, or a proof you are sharing for review. The message rides along with the document, so anyone who opens it understands its status immediately. Because the watermark sits over the content rather than replacing it, the document remains fully usable — readable, printable and shareable — while carrying its label everywhere it goes. That combination of clear signalling and untouched content is exactly why a diagonal text watermark has become the standard way to mark drafts, copies and confidential material.",

The watermark is sized and angled to span each page diagonally, which is the classic, professional look and the hardest to crop out or ignore.

The text is drawn directly into the PDF as part of each page, so it travels with the file: it shows up when the document is opened in any reader, when it is shared, and when it is printed.

In1 makes this simple: you set a start time and an end time, and the tool produces a new video containing only that section. It is perfect for grabbing a highlight from a longer recording, removing the boring beginning and end of a screen capture, or isolating the exact few seconds you want to send. Because you keep only the portion you choose, the resulting file is also smaller and quicker to upload or message — you are sending the moment, not the whole reel. Setting a precise start and end also means you do not have to rely on whoever watches it to skip ahead; the clip simply begins where the interesting part begins and ends where it ends, which is exactly what a viewer expects from something shared deliberately rather than a raw recording dumped in full.",

Instead of re-encoding the whole video — which is slow, especially in the browser — it copies the existing audio and video streams directly into the new clip, simply discarding everything outside your chosen range. That means trimming is dramatically faster than a full conversion and there is no loss of quality at all, since the original frames and audio are passed through untouched. The trade-off worth knowing about is that, to keep this speed and quality, the cut snaps to the nearest keyframe near your start point, so the clip may begin a fraction of a second from the exact time you typed. For the vast majority of uses that is imperceptible, and in return you get a near-instant, lossless trim instead of a long wait while every frame is rebuilt.",

WebM is a free, open format designed for the web that often produces smaller files and is preferred by some web apps and platforms. In1 converts between the two so you can take a WebM that will not open in your editor and turn it into an MP4, or convert an MP4 into a lighter WebM for embedding on a page.

To keep things responsive and avoid running out of memory, there is a sensible size limit on the file you can load, and very large or long videos are better handled by a desktop application. We use a fast encoder preset so the wait stays reasonable, and a progress bar keeps you informed throughout.

You pick the part of the clip to capture and a few quality settings, and the tool produces a ready-to-use animated GIF. Because a GIF needs no audio track and no player controls, it is often the friendliest way to share a brief moving image — it just plays, everywhere, the instant it loads. For short, silent, looping moments, a GIF communicates faster than asking someone to click play on a video. And because GIFs are treated as images rather than media, they slip into places a video file often cannot go — an issue comment, a wiki page, a chat that does not embed players, or an email — and start moving the instant they appear, with no thumbnail to tap and no controls to fumble with.",

The width sets the dimensions of the GIF; a smaller size keeps it light for chat and email, while a larger one shows more detail. And because GIFs balloon in size with every extra second, you choose a start point and a short duration to capture, keeping the result manageable. Together these three settings let you dial in exactly the GIF you want: a tiny, snappy reaction loop, or a slightly larger, smoother demo. Seeing how the choices affect the output helps you find the sweet spot between looking good and staying small enough to share.",

A few seconds at a modest size produces a shareable file; a long, high-frame-rate, full-size GIF can be enormous — far larger than the original video — and slow to load. That is why In1 focuses on short captures with adjustable quality, so you get a GIF that is actually practical to send and embed. If you need a long clip with sound, a video format is the right tool; but for a brief, silent, looping moment that needs to play instantly and everywhere, a compact GIF is exactly right, and keeping it short is what keeps it usable.",

Seeing the two figures side by side lets you match whichever rule applies without recounting by hand or pasting your text into another program.

'Keep paragraphs' is the smart option for documents: it flattens the lines inside each paragraph but preserves the blank line between paragraphs, so a multi-section article stays readable instead of collapsing into one giant wall of text. You can switch between the modes and watch the result update immediately, picking whichever output matches what you are pasting the text into next.",

In1 tidies that up as part of the same pass. When it joins lines, it collapses the runs of extra spaces and tabs that tend to accumulate at the seams down to single spaces, and it trims whitespace from the ends, so the output reads as if it had been typed cleanly in the first place. In the 'Keep paragraphs' mode it also drops empty stretches so you do not end up with three or four blank lines between sections. The goal is text you can paste straight into a document, a form, a chat message or a content management system without a second round of find-and-replace to fix the spacing the line breaks left behind. That single combined pass — breaks handled and spacing normalized together — is what separates a genuinely useful cleanup from one that simply trades one formatting problem for another.",

Remove Duplicate Lines does it in one pass. It reads your list line by line, keeps the first occurrence of each unique line and discards every later repeat, then shows you the cleaned result along with a count of how many duplicates it removed.

'Reverse line order' leaves every line untouched but flips the top-to-bottom sequence, turning a list that runs first-to-last into one that runs last-to-first.

A good slug is lowercase, uses hyphens instead of spaces, contains only safe characters and reads clearly to both people and search engines. Getting it right matters more than it first appears. Clean, descriptive slugs are easier to read, share and remember, they look trustworthy when pasted into a message, and they give search engines another clear signal about what a page is about, which can help with ranking and click-through. Messy slugs full of spaces, capital letters, accents or punctuation get percent-encoded into unreadable strings, break in some systems, and look unprofessional. This tool takes any title and produces a slug that follows all the conventions automatically, so you do not have to remember the rules or clean each one up by hand.",

Punctuation and symbols that have no place in a clean URL are removed. Runs of spaces, hyphens and underscores are collapsed into a single separator, and any separators left dangling at the start or end are trimmed away. The result is a tidy slug with no surprises. Because every transformation happens as you type, you can watch a title turn into its slug in real time and immediately see the effect of your wording, which makes it easy to tweak a title until the slug reads exactly the way you want it to.",

You can also choose whether to force everything to lowercase — the safest and most common option, since URLs are often case-sensitive and mixed casing can lead to duplicate-looking links — or preserve the original capitalization when you specifically need it. The options update the output instantly, so you can compare styles at a glance and pick the one that fits where the slug is going. Sensible defaults mean that for most people the tool produces exactly the right result without touching any settings at all, while the options are there the moment a specific platform or house style needs something different.",

This turns what could be dozens of individual conversions into a single instant operation, which is a real time-saver for bloggers, developers and anyone migrating or bulk-creating content. The order is preserved so you can line the slugs up against your original titles, and because everything runs locally there is no limit on how many lines you can convert at once beyond what your own device handles, which in practice means very long lists are no problem.",

Developers wire slugs into routing and file names, e-commerce teams generate product handles in bulk, and documentation authors keep anchor links tidy and predictable.

In1 generates as much or as little of it as you need on demand. Instead of copying the same tired paragraph from somewhere and pasting it over and over to fill a space, you choose the amount you want and get a fresh block instantly, sized to your layout.

Choose words when you need to fill a precise, short space such as a headline, a button label, a menu item or a meta field, where the exact length matters more than the shape.

Other times you would rather the filler start with varied text so it does not always look identical, especially when you are generating several separate blocks on the same page. In1 lets you toggle the classic opening on or off to suit the situation. When it is on, your text leads with the canonical phrase; when it is off, you get freshly assembled filler from the first word.

Print and graphic designers flow dummy text into brochures, posters and layouts to evaluate typography. Writers and editors use it to block out the structure of a document before the words are ready. Marketers and product teams populate wireframes for reviews and presentations. Students learning design or development use it while practicing layouts. Anyone who has ever needed 'some text, any text' to see how a design looks when it is not empty benefits from a generator that produces the right amount on demand, in the unit they need, without hunting for a paragraph to copy. Agencies fill client mockups before the copywriting is signed off, app developers seed demo screens for screenshots, and teachers create sample passages for typography and reading exercises. Generating fresh filler each time also avoids the oddly distracting effect of seeing the exact same placeholder paragraph repeated across every block of a page, which keeps a mockup feeling like a real, varied design rather than a template stuffed with one cloned sentence.",

In1 also shows a count of additions and removals, giving you an instant sense of how big the change really is.

Word-by-word comparison drills deeper, highlighting the specific words that changed within otherwise similar text, which is what you want when two paragraphs are mostly the same and you need to pinpoint the exact edits inside them. You can switch between the modes instantly and watch the highlighting change, so it is easy to start with a line-level overview to see the shape of the change and then drop to word level to examine a particular passage in detail.

Comparing the before and after versions surfaces every difference, so you can verify that the edits are exactly the ones you meant to make and nothing slipped in unnoticed. It is equally useful in the other direction: when someone hands you a revised document, a diff shows you precisely what they touched instead of forcing you to re-read the whole thing looking for changes.

Converting by hand is tedious and error-prone, especially for anything with nested lists, links, code blocks or tables. This tool does it in an instant. You paste your Markdown and it produces clean, correct HTML that you can copy straight into a page, a template or a content management system.

Add a heading and it appears, styled, the instant you type the hash; start a list and watch it indent; paste a link and see it become clickable. This immediate feedback makes writing Markdown faster and far more pleasant, especially for longer documents where small formatting mistakes are easy to miss in raw text.

Because the rendering matches the conventions used in README files, documentation and notes apps, what you compose here will look the same when you take it elsewhere.

Its purpose is to give something an identifier that is, for all practical purposes, guaranteed never to collide with another one — even if it was generated on a different machine, in a different system, with no coordination between them. That property makes UUIDs the default choice for primary keys in distributed databases, identifiers for files and records, correlation IDs in logs and traces, idempotency keys for API requests, and anywhere two systems need to agree on a name for something without asking a central authority for the next number. Because the space of possible version 4 UUIDs is astronomically large, the chance of two randomly generated ones matching is so small it can be safely ignored. This tool produces them on demand, so you can grab a fresh identifier whenever you need one without writing a line of code or running a script.",

The result is a properly formed, standards-compliant version 4 UUID with the correct version and variant bits set, indistinguishable from one produced by a server library. Whether you need an identifier for a throwaway test, a database seed, a configuration file or a production system, you can trust that what comes out is both correctly formatted and genuinely random.

Instead of generating them one at a time and pasting each into place, you create the whole set in one step and copy it as a block, ready to drop wherever it needs to go. Each identifier in the batch is independently random, so there is no pattern or sequence linking them. Need more later? Generate another batch with a single click.

You can toggle hyphens on or off and switch between lower and upper case, and the whole batch updates to match. This means you do not have to run the output through a separate find-and-replace step to get the exact format your target expects — you choose it up front and copy a batch that is ready to use as-is. Small as these formatting options are, they remove a common source of friction when moving generated identifiers between tools that each have their own conventions.

The trouble is that a number like 1700000000 means nothing to a human reading it. This converter bridges that gap. Paste a timestamp and it instantly shows you the date and time it represents, in formats you can actually read, so you can make sense of a value pulled from a database row, an API response, a JWT, a cookie or a log line. Going the other way, you can enter a normal date and get back the timestamp a system expects.

Paste the wrong assumption into a naive converter and you get a date thousands of years off. In1 detects the scale for you: a ten-digit value is treated as seconds and a thirteen-digit value as milliseconds, so you usually do not have to think about it at all. It then reports the result in both seconds and milliseconds, so whichever unit the next system expects, you have the right number ready to copy.

Seeing them together makes it easy to reason about scheduling, expiry times, log correlation across regions, and any task where getting the timezone wrong has real consequences.

It is also handy as a reference point while you are converting other timestamps, letting you see at a glance whether a value is in the past or the future relative to the present moment. Because the clock runs entirely in your browser, it reflects your own device's time and keeps ticking whether or not you have a network connection.

That safe form is percent-encoding, where each disallowed character is replaced by a percent sign followed by its hexadecimal byte value: a space becomes %20, an ampersand becomes %26, and so on. Without it, a search term containing a space or a parameter value containing an ampersand would break the URL or be misread by the server.

But when you encode a single value that will go inside a URL, such as a query parameter or a path segment, those very same characters need to be encoded so they are treated as data rather than structure. In1 gives you both modes. The component mode encodes everything that is not safe, which is what you want for an individual parameter value. The full-URL mode preserves the reserved structural characters, which is what you want when encoding a complete address.

This is invaluable when you are debugging, auditing where a link really points before you click it, or simply trying to understand a URL someone sent you. In1 decodes both full URLs and individual components, reversing the percent-encoding and restoring spaces, symbols and accented characters to their normal form.

The less-than and greater-than signs delimit tags, the ampersand begins an entity, and quotes delimit attribute values. If you want to show those characters as text — to display a snippet of code, a math expression, or a company name like 'Tom & Jerry' — you have to write them as HTML entities instead: &lt; for less-than, &gt; for greater-than, &amp; for the ampersand, and so on. Doing this is also the foundation of preventing cross-site scripting, because escaping user-supplied text before putting it into a page stops it from being interpreted as active markup.

Decoding turns all of that back into the characters it represents, so &lt;a href=&quot;x&quot;&gt; becomes the readable tag again and &amp; becomes a simple ampersand. In1 decodes both the named entities and the numeric ones using the browser's own HTML parser, which means it understands the full range of entities a real browser does — not just a short hand-coded list — so even unusual or rare entities are decoded correctly.

With the non-ASCII option turned on, In1 converts each such character into its numeric HTML entity, guaranteeing that the output contains only plain ASCII while still rendering as the original text in any browser. This can prevent garbled characters when content passes through older email systems, certain databases, or templating setups with uncertain encoding. When you do not need that, you can leave the option off and encode only the characters that actually have special meaning in HTML, keeping the output compact and readable.

This decoder does that for you, splitting the token into its parts and turning the encoded segments back into readable, pretty-printed JSON. You can immediately see the algorithm and token type in the header, and the claims in the payload: who the token is about, who issued it, what permissions or roles it carries, and when it is valid.

Squinting at a ten-digit number to work out whether a token is still good is exactly the kind of friction that slows down debugging. In1 reads these claims and shows them as ordinary human-readable dates and times, and it flags an expired token directly, so you can tell at a glance whether the token you are looking at is current or stale. This is invaluable when you are chasing down an authentication problem: very often the answer is simply that the token has expired, and seeing that spelled out in plain language — rather than buried in an epoch integer — turns a confusing failure into an obvious one you can fix in seconds.",

Verification requires the secret or public key that signed the token, and it must always be done on the server, never trusted to the client. So this decoder is the right tool for reading and debugging — seeing the claims, checking the expiry, understanding what a token contains — but it is not, and cannot be, a security check. Anyone can craft a string that decodes to whatever claims they like; only signature verification with the proper key tells you whether to trust it.

There is no run button to press and no waiting — the highlighting updates with each keystroke, so you can refine a pattern and watch the effect immediately. This tight loop is what makes building a regex manageable: instead of writing the whole thing and hoping, you grow it piece by piece, confirming at each step that it still matches what it should and nothing it shouldn't.

The multiline flag changes how the start-of-line and end-of-line anchors behave across multiple lines. The dotall flag lets the dot match newline characters, which matters when your text spans several lines. The unicode flag enables proper handling of characters beyond the basic range. Understanding which flag does what is half of mastering regular expressions, and being able to flip each one and instantly watch the matches change is the fastest way to build that intuition.

This is invaluable when you are using a regex to extract fields from log lines, parse a structured string, or reformat text with group references in a replacement. Instead of guessing whether group one is the area code and group two is the number, you can see the captured values laid out for every match and verify your pattern before you rely on it elsewhere.

Enter a hex color component and read its decimal value; type a decimal number and see its binary form; paste a binary string and get the hex.

For browsing, filtering, sorting and sharing, a spreadsheet is far more natural, and spreadsheets speak CSV. This converter bridges the two. You paste a JSON array of objects and it produces CSV where each object becomes a row and each key becomes a column, ready to open in Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers or any tool that imports CSV. Instead of writing a script, wrangling a one-off parser, or manually retyping values into cells, you get a clean, correctly structured table in a single step. This is exactly what you need when an API hands you JSON but your colleague wants a spreadsheet, when you want to eyeball an export, or when the next tool in your workflow only accepts tabular data. The conversion preserves your data while changing its shape into something immediately usable.",

In1 scans every object in your array and builds the column list from the union of all their keys, so if some records have fields that others lack, every field still gets a column and missing values are simply left blank rather than throwing the rows out of alignment. Values that are themselves objects or arrays are serialized so they still fit in a cell instead of breaking the output. This tolerance for irregular data means you can throw a real API response or database export at it without first cleaning everything into a perfectly rectangular shape. The result is a CSV whose header row reflects all the fields present across your data and whose rows line up correctly underneath, which is precisely what a spreadsheet needs to import the file cleanly.

The CSV standard handles all of this by wrapping problematic values in quotes and doubling any quotes inside them, and In1 applies those rules correctly so your output imports cleanly no matter what the values contain. Names with commas, descriptions with line breaks, text with embedded quotes — all of it survives the round trip intact. This careful escaping is the difference between a CSV that opens perfectly in a spreadsheet and one that looks fine at a glance but has rows misaligned by a stray comma three hundred entries down.

The result is exactly the shape most code, APIs and configuration expect, ready to drop into a project, send to an endpoint, or load into a tool that consumes JSON. Instead of writing a throwaway parser every time someone hands you a CSV, or wrestling with splitting strings and lining up columns, you get clean, correctly keyed JSON in a single step.

A naive converter that simply splits on commas falls apart the moment a value contains one, silently producing extra columns and misaligned data. In1 uses a proper parser that understands quoted fields, so a description with a comma, an address spanning multiple lines, or text with embedded quotes is read as a single value exactly as intended. This is what separates a converter you can trust on real exports from one that only works on the simplest, cleanest input.

This automatic keying is what turns a flat table into genuinely structured data: you can reference fields by their names, the JSON is self-documenting, and anyone reading it understands what each value represents. It also means the converter adapts to whatever columns your CSV has, however many there are and whatever they are called, without any configuration.

YAML, with its indentation and minimal punctuation, is easier for humans to read and write, which is why it dominates configuration files for tools like Docker, Kubernetes, CI pipelines and countless others. Because both formats are everywhere, you constantly need to move data between them: turning an API's JSON response into readable YAML, or converting a YAML config into the JSON a program expects. This converter does that in either direction.

Switch it to YAML-to-JSON when you need to feed YAML-authored data into something that only speaks JSON, such as an API, a JavaScript program or a tool that does not parse YAML. The output updates the moment you type or flip the direction, so you can paste into either side and immediately get the other.

Both JSON and YAML have strict syntax, and a misplaced comma, a bad indent or an unclosed quote makes the input unparseable. Instead of failing silently or producing garbage, the converter validates your input and shows a clear error message describing what went wrong, so you can find and fix the problem quickly.

This parser removes the guesswork by translating any cron expression into a clear, human-readable sentence. Paste the expression and it tells you, in plain English, exactly when the job runs — for that example, 'at 09:00, Monday through Friday'. Instead of mentally parsing each field and reconstructing the schedule in your head, you read it like a sentence.

By turning the whole expression into a sentence, the parser makes the combined meaning of all five fields obvious, so you do not have to reason about each one in isolation and then try to merge them correctly in your head. This is especially helpful for the edge cases where a small change has a surprising effect — adding a step value, narrowing a range, or switching a wildcard to a specific value can shift a schedule in ways that are not obvious from the raw text but are immediately clear once the expression is spelled out in words you can read and sanity-check.",

Each one shows both the expression and a short note about what it does, so you can see the pattern and adapt it to your own needs rather than starting from a blank field and a half-remembered format. Loading an example also immediately shows its plain-English translation, which reinforces how each part of the syntax maps to a real schedule. This makes the parser a learning aid as much as a decoder: by tapping through a few examples and reading both the raw expression and its meaning side by side, you build an intuition for how cron works that sticks far better than reading a syntax table.",

In1 validates the expression as you type and, when it cannot make sense of it, shows a clear error message instead of guessing or staying silent. That immediate feedback lets you catch a malformed expression the moment you write it, while you still have the context to fix it, rather than discovering the problem later when a scheduled task misbehaves.

Code 39 is common in industrial and ID applications. EAN-13 and EAN-8 are the retail product codes used on consumer goods worldwide, while UPC-A is the equivalent standard in North America. ITF-14 is used on shipping cartons, and Codabar appears in libraries, blood banks and logistics. Being able to pick the symbology means you can generate exactly the kind of barcode your scanner, retailer or system requires, rather than being limited to one format that may not be accepted. Switching formats updates the barcode immediately, so you can see how the same value looks across symbologies and choose the one that fits your use case.",

A barcode that violates these rules either will not generate or, worse, produces something that looks like a barcode but fails to scan, which is the kind of error you only discover at the worst possible moment. In1 validates your input against the chosen format and tells you clearly when the value is not valid for it, explaining that the length or characters do not fit. This prevents you from printing a sheet of labels only to find they are unreadable. It also helps you learn each format's requirements, since the immediate feedback shows you exactly what a given symbology will and will not accept. When the tool does render a barcode, you can trust that it is well-formed for that format and stands a proper chance of scanning correctly on real hardware.",

Nothing is uploaded, nothing is stored and there is no account.

This is the same standard built into modern phones, so it just works without any special app. You generate the code once and anyone can use it. It is perfect for a home where visitors come and go, and it transforms the experience from a fiddly exchange into an instant, effortless connection. Because the QR code encodes the credentials directly, even a complicated, secure password — exactly the kind you should be using — becomes trivial to share, which means you never have to weaken your WiFi security just to make it easier for guests to get online.",

Shops, clinics and waiting rooms offer it to customers. Even at home, a printed code by the door or on the fridge saves you from reciting the password to every visitor. Anywhere a guest network exists, a QR code is the cleanest way to share it: it works for everyone, it does not require handing out the raw password verbally, and it can be reprinted or replaced whenever the password changes.

You can also mark the network as hidden if it does not broadcast its name, so the scanning device knows to look for it. Getting these details right matters, because a QR code that specifies the wrong security type may fail to connect even when the name and password are correct.

This works for the loans people most commonly take out — personal loans, car loans and mortgages all use the same underlying math — so whether you are sizing up a vehicle purchase, a home loan or a personal borrowing need, the calculator gives you a realistic figure.

Seeing the interest figure laid out plainly is often eye-opening: it is the real price of borrowing, and it can be a substantial fraction of the loan itself, especially at higher rates or over longer terms. With these numbers in front of you, you can make a genuinely informed decision rather than fixating on the monthly payment alone.

Over time this snowball effect can turn modest, steady saving into a surprisingly large sum, because each period's growth becomes the base for the next period's growth. The catch is that compounding is hard to picture in your head — the curve is not a straight line, and small changes in rate or time produce outsized differences decades later. This calculator makes the effect concrete. You enter a starting amount, an annual interest rate and a number of years, and it projects the future value, showing you the result that compounding produces rather than leaving you to guess. Seeing the number is genuinely motivating, and it makes the abstract idea of 'letting your money grow' into something specific you can plan around, compare and aim for.",

This reflects how saving and investing actually work: you put money in regularly, and each deposit then compounds for the rest of the term. The effect of these ongoing contributions is enormous over long periods, often dwarfing the starting amount, and the calculator captures it so your projection matches a realistic saving plan rather than an unrealistic one-time deposit. You can see how much difference adding a little more each month makes, or how a consistent contribution over a long horizon builds up. This is exactly the kind of what-if that helps with real decisions — whether it is worth increasing a monthly transfer to a savings or investment account, or how much you would need to contribute to reach a target by a certain date.",

You can choose whether interest compounds yearly, quarterly, monthly or daily, and see how more frequent compounding produces a slightly higher result for the same rate, because interest starts earning interest sooner. More importantly, you control the number of years, and adjusting it reveals the single biggest lever in compounding: time. Because growth accelerates, the difference between, say, twenty and thirty years is far larger than the difference between ten and twenty. Being able to slide the time horizon and watch the future value respond drives home why starting early matters so much, and why patience is rewarded. Seeing these factors interact — rate, frequency, contributions and especially time — turns the calculator into a tool for understanding how saving works, not just a box that prints one number.",

Alongside the projected future value, it shows the total amount you invested — your starting sum plus all your contributions — and the interest earned, which is the difference between the two. This breakdown is illuminating because it reveals how much of your final balance is your own money versus growth that compounding generated for you. Early on, most of the balance is what you put in; over a long horizon, the earned interest can come to rival or exceed your contributions, which is compounding's whole promise made visible. Seeing the three figures together helps you appreciate the return your money is working to produce and keeps your expectations grounded in the actual contribution required.

The calculator also does not account for taxes, fees or inflation, all of which affect what your money is really worth in the end. So the figure it produces is best treated as an illustration of the compounding principle and a planning aid, not a promise of a specific outcome.

The calculation is straightforward: in metric units it is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in metres, and this calculator handles the equivalent formula for imperial units automatically. The result is a single figure that places you on a standard scale. BMI is popular because it requires only two measurements that anyone can obtain, needs no special equipment, and gives a quick, consistent indication that is useful for tracking changes over time and for comparing against widely published categories. This tool computes it for you in either unit system, so you do not have to remember the formula or convert between pounds, stones, kilograms, inches and centimetres yourself — you just enter your height and weight and read the number.",

The category is colour-coded so you can take in your result at a glance rather than having to look up where your number sits on a chart. These categories come from the same internationally used ranges that health organizations and clinicians reference, which makes your result easy to interpret and to discuss. Seeing the band, not just the figure, turns an abstract number into something meaningful — it tells you immediately whether your weight is generally considered to be in a healthy range for your height or whether it sits above or below it. Because the category updates the instant you change your inputs, you can also see how a different weight would shift your classification, which is useful if you are setting a goal or tracking progress toward one.",

You never have to convert your height into metres or your weight into kilograms, or remember the multiplier that imperial BMI requires. This matters because using the wrong units or mishandling a conversion produces a BMI that is badly wrong, which could be alarming or falsely reassuring. By letting you enter your measurements in the units you actually know them in, the tool keeps the input natural and the result accurate.

This calculator states that plainly alongside your result, because the responsible way to present BMI is with its caveats attached.

The calculator handles all of that correctly, accounting for the varying number of days in each month and for leap years, so the result is accurate rather than approximate. You simply enter the birth date and immediately see the exact age.

The total-days figure is also practical for any situation where a precise span matters — counting days toward a milestone, working out exact durations, or satisfying a requirement that is expressed in days rather than years. Because all of these totals are derived from the same accurate underlying calculation, they are consistent with each other and with the years-months-days result.

Leap years add an extra day every four years, with their own exceptions, which throws off any simple day-counting. This calculator deals with all of it properly: when the current day of the month is earlier than the birth day, it borrows the correct number of days from the actual previous month, and it counts total days using real calendar dates so leap days are included automatically. The upshot is that the age it reports is genuinely exact, not a rough estimate that drifts by a day or two.

There is no working it out on a napkin, no rounding errors, and no one quietly underpaying because the division was guessed rather than calculated. Because everything updates the moment you change a number, you can adjust the tip up or down and watch the per-person figure respond, settling on an amount that feels right.

The tip and the total recalculate instantly as you change the percentage, so it is easy to see the difference a few points makes and choose an amount you are comfortable with. This matters because the 'right' tip is genuinely situational, and a tool that insisted on one figure would be useless half the time.

The per-person figure also breaks out how much of each share is tip, so the split is transparent and nobody has to wonder how the number was reached.

No guessing, no rough estimates, no being caught out at the register when the total is higher than you assumed. Because the result updates the moment you change a number, you can check a price the instant you see a tag, compare what different discounts would cost, or work out whether a deal genuinely brings something into your budget.

A big percentage off a small item might save very little, while a modest percentage off an expensive one can be substantial, and the money figure makes that obvious in a way the percentage alone does not. Having both the final price and the saving side by side gives you the complete picture of a discount: what you pay and what you avoid paying.

The final price and saving recalculate instantly whichever way you set the discount, so it is just as fast to check a standard sale as an oddly specific one. This combination keeps the tool quick for the common cases without ever boxing you in when the number is unusual. It also makes it easy to compare: tap between a few preset discounts to see how the final price shifts, or type in the exact percentage from a coupon to confirm what it really brings the price down to.

This tool takes your WebP and produces a clean PNG you can use anywhere, removing the friction of a format that looks great online but causes trouble the moment you need it elsewhere.

WebP images frequently use an alpha channel for transparent backgrounds — think logos, icons and graphics meant to sit on top of other content — and PNG fully supports transparency too, so those see-through areas remain see-through in the converted file rather than being filled with an unwanted solid color. This makes the converter safe to use for graphics where the transparent background matters, not just for flat photographs.

This tool does that conversion in your browser, taking a PNG and re-encoding it as a JPG at a quality you choose.

Because you can see the resulting file size after converting, you can find the sweet spot for your particular image rather than accepting whatever a one-size-fits-all converter decides.

This tool fills transparent regions with white, which is the most common and sensible default and works well for the vast majority of cases. It means a transparent PNG becomes a JPG with a clean white background rather than a strange or unexpected one. For photographs, which have no transparency to begin with, this makes no difference at all. It is worth knowing about mainly for graphics: if preserving transparency is essential, PNG or WebP is the format to keep, but if you are converting a photo or are happy with a white background, JPG gives you a much smaller file.

PNG is lossless, so it is the preferred format whenever an image will be edited repeatedly — each time you save a JPG it loses a little more quality, whereas a PNG can be opened and re-saved without degrading. PNG is also the format many design tools, graphics workflows and applications expect, and it is required when you need crisp edges or plan to add transparency. Converting a JPG to PNG gives you a version that is ready for this kind of work: an editing-friendly, lossless file that will not accumulate compression artifacts as you work on it. This tool does the conversion in your browser, taking your JPG and producing a clean PNG, so you can move a photographic image into a workflow that calls for PNG without hunting for software or uploading your picture anywhere.",

This is the real value of the conversion: it gives you a lossless container so that all your subsequent work preserves the image exactly. For anyone doing iterative editing — touching up a photo, adding graphics or text, making repeated adjustments — starting from a PNG is the sensible choice, and converting your JPG up front means every save after that keeps full fidelity. The PNG will be larger than the JPG, which is the natural cost of lossless storage, but in exchange you get an image that no longer degrades each time you work on it.",

Even before you add transparency, PNG is the format graphics and design tools tend to favour, and it handles sharp lines, text and flat areas of color without the blocky artifacts JPG can introduce. Converting to PNG is therefore the first step in a lot of common image tasks: turning a photo into an asset you can edit freely, preparing an image for a logo or icon workflow, or simply getting a file into the format a particular tool requires.

Social media, a lot of document and presentation software, image editors and countless apps want a PNG or similar. Converting your SVG to PNG bridges that gap, turning the scalable drawing into a fixed-size image that any of these tools can use. This converter rasterizes your SVG in the browser and gives you a PNG you can drop anywhere a vector would be rejected. You keep the crisp, clean look of the original artwork; you just get it in the pixel-based form that the tool or platform you are using actually understands.",

This control is genuinely useful, because the right size depends entirely on the use: you might want a small PNG for a favicon or an inline icon, a medium one for a web graphic, or a large, high-resolution one for print or a hero image. Since the source is a vector, you can render at a high resolution and get a perfectly crisp result — there is no upscaling blur, because the image is drawn fresh at whatever size you request rather than enlarged from existing pixels. Being able to dial in the exact width means you get a PNG that fits its destination precisely, at the resolution that destination calls for, rather than being stuck with whatever a fixed conversion would produce.",

This matters a great deal for the kinds of graphics people convert: a logo or icon usually has a transparent background so it can sit on top of any color, and the resulting PNG keeps that transparency rather than filling it with white or another solid color. The result is a raster image that drops cleanly onto any background, just like the original vector would. You get the best of both worlds — the precision and clarity of vector artwork, rendered into a pixel image at your chosen resolution, with the see-through areas intact.

This tool takes any image and produces that data URI for you, encoding the file into Base64 and wrapping it in the correct data-URI prefix so it is ready to use. Encoding by hand is impractical, and getting the prefix or formatting wrong means the image silently fails to appear, so having a tool generate a correct, complete data URI removes a real source of friction.

It is also handy when an image needs to be entirely self-contained — embedded in an email, bundled into a single file, or used somewhere external files are awkward. The trade-off is size: Base64 encoding makes the data roughly a third larger than the original file, and large images bloat your HTML or CSS and cannot be cached separately, so inlining is best reserved for small assets. The tool shows you the encoded size so you can judge this for yourself.

        heading: "The hidden data inside your photos",
        body: "Every photo you take with a phone or camera carries more than just the image. Embedded invisibly inside the file is EXIF metadata: a record of when the photo was taken, the make and model of the device, the camera settings used, and — most sensitively — often the exact GPS coordinates of where you were standing. This information travels with the file when you share it, and most people have no idea it is there. That is a genuine privacy concern: posting a photo can inadvertently reveal your home address, your daily routine, or your precise location at a particular moment, simply because the location was baked into the image without you realizing. This tool removes that hidden data. It strips the EXIF metadata out of your photo so that what you share is just the picture, with none of the invisible details about where, when and how it was taken. It is a simple step that closes a privacy gap most people never knew they had.",

        body: "The most important reason to remove EXIF data is location privacy. Photos taken on a phone very often include precise GPS coordinates, and when you share such a photo — on social media, in a forum, with a stranger, or on a marketplace listing — anyone who downloads it can read exactly where it was taken. For a picture taken at home, that can mean handing over your address; for photos of children, pets or daily activities, it can reveal patterns about your life you never intended to make public. Removing the metadata before sharing closes that exposure. Beyond location, stripping EXIF also removes the device details and timestamps that can be used to profile or identify you, and it cleans up information you simply may not want attached to an image for professional or personal reasons. This tool makes that protective step quick and effortless, so cleaning a photo's metadata before you post or send it can become a normal habit rather than an afterthought you only remember too late.",

This tool works by re-saving your photo through a fresh canvas, which reproduces every pixel of the picture exactly while leaving all the hidden EXIF fields behind. The visible image — its content, its resolution, its appearance — is fully preserved; what disappears is only the invisible data that was attached to it. The output is a clean image you can use exactly as you would the original, just without the embedded location, device and timing information. This is the right way to handle the task: rather than editing or degrading the photo, it simply produces a copy that contains the picture and nothing else. You end up with an image that looks identical to the one you started with but carries none of the metadata you wanted gone, ready to share with confidence that it is not quietly revealing more than you intended.",

There is no account and no sign-up.

Because everything is local, it is also instant and works offline. You can clean a photo's metadata knowing that neither the original nor the cleaned version, and certainly not the location data inside it, ever leaves your computer.

Journalists, activists and sources remove EXIF to protect themselves and others when images could reveal sensitive locations. Professionals strip metadata from images before sending them to clients or publishing them, to avoid leaking device details or timestamps. Anyone who has realized that their photos might be quietly carrying their home coordinates has a reason to clean them. As awareness of image metadata grows, removing it before sharing is becoming a basic privacy hygiene step, much like thinking before you post.

Both are displayed for every pixel you pick, and each has a copy button, so you can grab whichever format the tool you are working in expects without any manual conversion. This matters because needing a color in the 'wrong' format is a common annoyance: you have the HEX but your software wants RGB, or vice versa. By presenting both and letting you copy either instantly, the picker fits straight into whatever workflow you are in. You click a pixel, see the color in both standard notations, and copy the one you need in a single click — turning 'what color is that?' into an answer you can paste directly into your stylesheet, your design tool or your document.",

You can click around to compare different areas, sampling as many points as you like until you find the exact shade you are after. This precision is what makes the tool genuinely useful rather than a rough guide: when you need to match a specific color, getting it from the exact pixel matters, because even areas that look uniform can vary, and gradients change continuously.

This is invaluable whenever you want to understand or reuse the color scheme of an image: a photograph whose mood you want to match, a design whose palette you admire, a brand image you need to coordinate with, or simply an inspiring picture you want to build a color scheme around.

This means you can lift any color from the palette straight into your stylesheet, your design tool or your document without conversion or retyping. Whether you want the single most dominant color, a couple of complementary shades, or the whole set to build a scheme, you can grab exactly what you need.

It takes the guesswork out of translating 'I love the colors in this picture' into specific values you can build with. Because the tool surfaces several dominant colors rather than just one, you get a coordinated set that already works together — they came from the same image, after all — which is a strong foundation for a harmonious scheme.

A blank, broken or unappealing preview makes a link easy to scroll past; a clear, attractive one draws the eye and communicates what the link is about before anyone reads a word. This tool lets you create that image without design software. You provide a title and supporting text, choose a look, and it produces a clean, professional share image sized exactly as social platforms expect. Instead of leaving your link previews to chance — or to whatever a platform scrapes automatically — you get to design the impression your link makes, which is well worth the minute it takes when that impression directly affects how many people engage.",

        body: "Open Graph images have a standard size — 1200 by 630 pixels — and getting it right matters more than it might seem. An image at the wrong dimensions gets awkwardly cropped, letterboxed or stretched when platforms render the preview, often cutting off your text or leaving ugly bars, which undermines the whole point. This tool produces images at exactly 1200×630, the dimensions that social networks and messaging apps are built around, so your share image displays cleanly and completely wherever the link appears. You do not have to look up the correct size, set up a canvas, or worry about how different platforms will treat your image — it comes out at the right ratio and resolution every time. The text is laid out with sensible margins so nothing sits too close to the edges where it might be trimmed. Getting the dimensions exactly right is the unglamorous but essential part of a good share image, and the tool handles it automatically so your previews always look intentional.",

        body: "A good share image communicates instantly, so this tool focuses on clear, readable text on a clean background. You add a headline, a supporting subtitle and a small footer label such as your site name, and the text is laid out with strong typographic hierarchy — a large, bold title with a lighter subtitle beneath — so the message reads at a glance even at thumbnail size. A choice of themes gives you different background and text color combinations, from dark and high-contrast to lighter, cleaner looks, so you can match the tone of your content or brand without making any design decisions yourself. Long titles wrap sensibly so they fit within the image rather than overflowing. The result is a share image that looks deliberate and professional rather than thrown together, with the text doing the work of telling people what the link offers. You get a polished, on-message preview without needing any design skill, just by typing your text and picking a theme that fits.",

You see exactly how your title, subtitle and footer sit on the chosen background in real time, so you can adjust your wording to fit, try different themes, and get the balance right before you commit. There is no exporting and re-checking — what you see in the preview is precisely what you download. When it looks right, a single click saves the image as a PNG at the full 1200×630 resolution, ready to set as your page's Open Graph image or to use anywhere a share graphic is needed. This immediate, visual workflow makes creating a share image quick and almost enjoyable rather than a chore, and it means you can produce a tailored image for each important page or post in moments.

Developers and indie makers generate share images for their projects, apps and documentation without commissioning a designer. Small business owners create previews for the pages they promote. Newsletter writers and community managers make graphics for the links they circulate. Anyone launching something — a product, an article, an event — wants the shared link to look compelling rather than blank. Because the tool produces correctly sized images with readable text and clean themes, previewed live and downloaded instantly, it lets people who are not designers create professional-looking share images in moments.

        body: "A favicon is the small icon that represents your website — the little image in the browser tab, in bookmarks, and on a phone's home screen when someone saves your site. The complication is that modern sites need this icon at several different sizes, because browsers, operating systems and devices each ask for different dimensions: a tiny one for the tab, larger ones for bookmarks and app icons, a specific size for Apple devices, and more for web app manifests. Producing all of these by hand means resizing the same image over and over, which is tedious and easy to get inconsistent. This generator does it from a single source image. You provide one picture and it creates the full set of sizes for you in one step, each one a clean resize of your original. Instead of opening an image editor and exporting size after size, you get the complete range a website needs at once, ready to drop into your site, which removes one of the more annoying chores in setting up a site's branding.",

        heading: "Includes the sizes browsers and devices expect",

That includes the small icons for browser tabs, the medium sizes used for bookmarks and shortcuts, the larger sizes referenced by web app manifests for when a site is installed or saved to a home screen, and a dedicated apple-touch-icon at the size Apple devices look for. Covering this range means your site's icon shows up crisply everywhere it might appear, rather than being scaled awkwardly from a single ill-fitting size. The icons are delivered as PNGs, which every browser supports, and named clearly so you can tell which is which. By generating the standard set in one go, the tool takes care of the compatibility details so you do not have to research what sizes are required or worry that you have missed one. You end up with a kit that covers the common cases, ready to reference from your site's markup and manifest.",

That is why this tool shows you a preview of how your image looks at small favicon sizes before you download anything. Seeing the icon at the dimensions it will actually appear lets you judge whether it works — whether the detail holds up, whether it is still recognizable, whether you need a simpler or more square source image. This quick check can save you from publishing a favicon that looks fine in your editor but turns to mush in the browser tab. The general rule it helps you apply is that favicons work best when they are simple, bold and roughly square, and the preview makes any problems with your chosen image obvious immediately. Being able to see the result at true size before committing means the icon set you download is one you have actually confirmed looks good where it counts.",

The icons are bundled into a zip file locally and downloaded directly, with no file ever travelling to a server. This local-only approach is the right default for branding work, where an unreleased logo should stay on your machine, but it benefits everyone by keeping the tool fast and your image private. Because it all happens locally, generation is instant and works offline too. You can create favicon sets from as many images as you like, free and without watermarks, knowing that your logo or mark — and the icons made from it — never leave your own computer.",

Indie makers and solo founders building their own sites need favicons but do not want to wrestle with exporting a dozen sizes by hand. Small business owners setting up a site want their logo to appear properly in browser tabs and on phone home screens. Bloggers and hobbyists adding a personal touch to their site generate an icon from an image. Anyone who has noticed the blank or default icon next to their site in a browser tab and wanted to replace it with their own has a use for a generator.

This tool takes your screenshots and assembles them into one PDF, putting each image on its own page. Instead of attaching a dozen separate files to an email or message and hoping the recipient views them in the right sequence, you send one tidy document.

This control is what turns a set of screenshots into a proper document: a bug report where the steps appear in the right sequence, a guide whose instructions flow logically, a record whose pages are in chronological order.

Because it accepts the common image formats, you can mix sources freely, and each one lands on its own page in the order you set. The result is a flexible way to gather any collection of images into a single, ordered, universally openable document.
